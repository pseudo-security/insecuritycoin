The cryptocoin you don't want

InsecurityCoin (IC) is a company/organization-specific coin that has no value outside of said organization. It cannot be traded on any exchanges. The miner is hard-capped to consume at most 1% CPU utilization. When deployed, the miner generates a new wallet tied to the device it runs on. As the miner mines, the wallet accrues funds. The more funds an address has, the more risk/liability is associated to that device. Blue Teams are incentivized to remove the miner and patch to prevent new deploys, while Red Teams are incentivized to keep deploying the miner on the network. IC then becomes a proxy for simulating ransomware events, where each company can set an internal price per coin. As an address is associated to a specific device, an interesting mechanism emerges. Addresses act as individual "stocks" and a team or product-line thus has a series of IC addresses associated to them, which can then be tracked as if a mutual or index fund. In this way, companies can make bets on improving their security posture through options. Thus, IC can be thought of as "king-of-the-castle ctf meets ransomware meets wallstreetbets"
